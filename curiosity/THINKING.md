Entry 1 (Markets and Movies): 

I wonder if there is a correlation between how well the stock market (S&P 500) was doing before, during, and after the recession and how well movies were rated from those years...

Inside of the movie data folder are 1 million records of movies with ratings from users on imdb

In the market folder, there is historical data from the SP500 including dividends, interest rates, price level, etc
