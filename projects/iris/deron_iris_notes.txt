Title: On Morphological Classifications of the Iris Flower
Subjects: Various Iris Flowers
Problem Type: Classification

Purpose: To classify variations of Iris flowers based on their morphological attributes

Materials:
  - Data sets by Edgar Anderson and Gape Peninsula.

Methods:
  - Collection & Preparation: Collect Data, Prepare Code, Setup structure of data, Enter Data, Screen Data
  - Exploration: Descriptive Stats, Graphs
  - Analysis: Explore relationships between variables, group comparison

  Observations:
    - Iris setosa which looks slightly withered and conic with occasional bright yellow and white finishes on the insides of the "cones."
      Also seems to have little variation from the stem in 3's

    - Iris versicolor appears more vibrant than setosa, having a similar sprout of 3's from the stem.
      On the edges of the central flowering body, there appear to be flat beds with the same touch as seen I. setosa's conics.

    - Iris virginica presents the 3 flowering bodies from the center but appears most pale and white.
      It is quite similar to I. versicolor in more respects than it is to setosa. Flat beds with more of a pronounced yellow "stain."


  Hypotheses:
    Drawing a testable hypothesis we will establish the null hypothesis,
    alternative hypothesis, all with a P-value of < 0.05

  We use R to make our determinations. First must install R.
    Goals:
      - Install R,
      - Add packages from Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)

    Installing R on Ubuntu 16:
      - sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9

   Here are some basic functions in R:
